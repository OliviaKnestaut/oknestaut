## About Olivia

I am a User Experience & Interaction Design Student at Drexel University who is passionate about creativity, problem-solving, and nature.

One of my main goals is to get involved with the improvement of accessibility in media. I want to promote the consideration of a range of disabilities throughout every step of the process of technology development.

Outside of the digital world, you many find me crocheting, taking care of houseplants, or traveling the US National Parks.

### Get In Touch

I am always looking for collaborations and project ideas. If you want to chat about design, books, plants, or anything else, don't hesitate to reach out.
