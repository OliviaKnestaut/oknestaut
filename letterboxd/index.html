                    This project is a microinteraction design to improve the Letterboxd movie tile. It was created for the class IDM 241, Microinteraction Design, under the direction of Professor Jervis Thompson. Working individually, but with class and instructor support, we were tasked to redesign and develop a microinteraction ecosystem with five plus interactions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over 10+ weeks I brainstormed, designed, and created three different builds as I progressed through the project. Through each step of the process I emphasized ease of use, brand consistency, and engaging animations. The final build includes not only the developed microinteraction, but also detailed descriptions of the triggers, rules, feedback, loops and modes for each microinteraction in the tile.

                    <p>
                        Letterboxd is a social media platform for film enthusiasts. On Letterboxd, members can interact with films by liking, rating, reviewing, and adding shows to watchlists. The specific focus of this project was on improving the interactivity of the movie tile, a critical element of the Letterboxd interface that provides users with quick access to essential movie details. Over the span of 10 weeks, I worked individually to conceptualize, design, and develop my improved microinteractions.
                        <br><br>The project operated within the constraints of academic guidelines, requiring the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce a functional prototype. Each interaction was designed to align with Letterboxd's existing branding while emphasizing ease of use and engaging visual feedback. My iterative process included multiple design phases, culminating in a final build with detailed documentation of the interaction functionality.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="color-blue">THE PROBLEM</h4>

                    <p>
                        The Letterboxd movie tile serves as a gateway to key information and interactions with a film, but its current design (see video below) is in need of improvements to become more intuitive and visually engaging. Currently, the buttons within the tile only take up a very small overlay space at the bottom of the tile. This area can be difficult for some users to target or see. Additionally, one of the most important features, rating a movie, is hidden within the “more” menu. During an interaction, most changes either buffer or happen instantly without any transition.
                        <br><br>Without effective microinteractions, users may experience friction when trying to access or interact with movie details, which diminishes the overall user experience. This project sought to solve this problem by redesigning the tile and its elements to deliver a smoother, more visually engaging, and efficient interaction flow, improving both user satisfaction and platform usability.

                    <h4 class="color-blue">GOALS &amp; OBJECTIVES</h4>
                    <p>The success of this project was defined by achieving the following tangible goals:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Ease of Use:</b> Ensure that all interactions are intuitive and require minimal user effort</li>
                        <li><b>Engaging Animations:</b> Introduce visually appealing animations that enhance the experience without overwhelming the user</li>
                        <li><b>Brand Consistency:</b> Maintain alignment with Letterboxd's existing aesthetic and incorporate their brand colors</li>
                        <li><b>Functionality:</b> Build a fully functioning prototype using HTML, CSS and JS with documentation of the triggers, rules, feedback, loops and modes</li>
                        <li><b>Iterative Improvement:</b> Incorporate feedback from peers, the instructor, and self-assessment to improve the design through three iterative builds</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        By successfully meeting these goals, the redesigned microinteraction would not only enhance the user experience but also serve as a showcase of technical and design skills in microinteraction design.

                <p>
                    To begin the process I first had to evaluate the microinteraction as it currently exists on Letterboxd. To do this I created my alpha description where I analyzed the main movie tile interaction. In my description I discovered that the triggers for the tile were hovering on, hovering on and waiting for a 2 second delay, hovering off, and clicking on the movie tile (mouse up). These triggers informed my detailing of the rules which primarily included the tile border appearing, the icon overlay appearing, and navigation away from the page on click. The tile interaction alone does not write to the backend, so the feedback section is the same as the rules. The modes that appear include the icon overlay and the movie title.
                    <br><br>Based on the description I detailed I had to code my alpha build. I incorporated all the triggers, rules, feedback, loops and modes that are in the original, in and effort to make my replica as close as possible. This version only includes the tile object, not the sub buttons like the eye and heart. I completed this build using only HTML and CSS.

                <div class="d-flex gap-1 justify-content-center button-flex">
                    <button type="button" class="m-3 btn btn-primary d-block purple-hover bg-purple righton-btn" onclick="window.open('https://oknestaut.netlify.app/idm241/beta', '_blank')">

                    </button>
                </div>

                <p>
                    While the alpha was meant to model the existing microinteraction, the beta is where I began to make changes to improve the design. I also had to start incorporating more sub interactions within the tile. For the beta, I focused on 3 microinteractions: the tile, the view button, and the like button. While completing the description I realized that buttons like the view eye and like heart had multiple states that needed to be detailed out. I mocked up the intended designs in Figma, breaking out the different triggers and parts of the flow. These graphics helped provide me with a visual guide to follow as I coded my interactions.

                    Based on the graphics and detailed description I coded by beta build. I incorporated all the triggers, rules, feedback, loops and modes in my description. This build focuses on the tile, view button, and like button. It again uses HTML and CSS but also incorporates JS to manage the state changes between default and active for the buttons. I focused on developing smooth color transitions for the borders to create a satisfying visual when the users press a button.

                <p>
                    Building off of the functionality of the beta I moved into designing my final. I created more Figma mockups to detail the final microinteractions I would include. These were the star ratings, the clear ratings button, and the more menu. Of all the microinteractions I incorporated into this project, the star rating system was both the most complex to design and develop. It allows users to rate movies in increments of half stars and change their ratings as well. Ultimately, my final build ended up varying from my Figma mockups a bit especially for the star rating designs.

                    While developing these interactions I wanted to incorporate the brand colors of orange, blue and green more throughout the designs. The main way that I brought this in was through the button and border colors when a button is selected. The like button is orange, the view button is green, and the rating system is blue. These colors also transition seamlessly between one another when a different button is selected. In order to do this I had to create a hierarchy regarding what buttons overwrite the border colors. There is a very complex system that connects these three color-associated buttons and their meta interactions. Another change that was important to me was bringing the rating system outside of the menu so it is more accessible and emphasized.

                    This project successfully achieved its objectives, delivering a polished and functional prototype that enhanced the microinteraction ecosystem for the Letterboxd movie tile. Key outcomes include:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Ease of Use:</b> The redesigned tile simplifies interactions, with intuitive triggers and easily accessible elements like the star rating system, which was moved out of the “more” menu for greater visibility</li>
                    <li><b>Engaging Animations:</b> Smooth color transitions and responsive animations were implemented, creating a satisfying and visually appealing user experience</li>
                    <li><b>Brand Consistency:</b> Letterboxd's branding was seamlessly integrated into the design through the consistent use of its orange, green, and blue color palette</li>
                    <li><b>Functionality:</b> The prototype features fully functional microinteractions, such as the star rating system and toggle buttons for “like” and “viewed” states. Each microinteraction is underpinned by detailed documentation of triggers, rules, feedback, and modes</li>
                    <li><b>Iterative Improvement:</b> Feedback from peers and the instructor was incorporated across three builds, resulting in a refined final product</li>

                <h4 class="color-blue">TAKEAWAYS</h4>
                <p>This project underscored the importance of balancing functionality with aesthetics in interaction design. Moving the star rating system out of the “more” menu improved accessibility, highlighting the importance of designing for visibility and ease of use. The multi-phase process—alpha, beta, and final builds—allowed for continuous refinement, which helped uncover and address usability challenges. Finally, Implementing smooth transitions and hierarchical color rules for buttons was technically complex but critical for creating a cohesive and engaging user experience.
                </p>
                <h4 class="color-blue">AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT</h4>
                <p>While the Figma mockups provided a strong foundation, the final build deviated from the initial designs, particularly in the star rating system. In the future, I would allocate more time to prototyping to ensure greater alignment between mockups and development. It would also be helpful to conduct usability tests with the target audience to provide feedback to refine the designs.</p>
